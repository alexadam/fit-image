# fit-image

A simple tool to embed a screenshot in an image that meets some size constraints

![demo](demo.png?raw=true "Demo")

## **Demo**


## Why?

Because every time I have to upload a new version of [Save as eBook](https://github.com/alexadam/save-as-ebook),
the screenshots must have a certain size. Instead of wasting time trying to do a perfect screenshot, I prefer
to do a "random" screenshot and embed it in an image that meets those constraints.
